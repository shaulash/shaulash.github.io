PhD Researcher at the University of Glasgow 
<H2>About Me</H2>
I am a PhD researcher in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. 
I am conducting interdisciplinary research on social robots at the 
[UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Social AI](https://socialcdt.org/). 
My doctoral work focuses on developing a social robot designed to support human staff who assist newcomers in 
navigating bureaucratic processes. 
The overarching aim is to create a robot that can help refugees and asylum seekers access essential services in the UK.
My research interests include human-robot interaction, marginalized populations and multilingualism.
