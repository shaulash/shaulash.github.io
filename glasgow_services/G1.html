   <h2>Food Hubs</h2>
    <div class="item"><strong>Poverty Relief</strong><p>Every Sunday, 1Pm - 3PM, our volunteers distribute food parcels to destitute asylum seekers and refugees.

Every Ramadhan, we provide additional food packs to destitute asylum seekers. These food packs are a lifeline to our service users, some of whom have no income or accommodation.

We aim to continue our food distribution and are working with our scholars to create a trust fund, through which funds can be given directly to impoverished and destitute people within Glasgow.</p><p>1 Mosque Avenue, Glasgow, G5 9TA</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.852292,-4.2513009" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>The Everlasting Foodbank</strong><p>The Everlasting Foodbank is a warm safe space for vulnerable and disadvantaged families and individuals. We provide support through warm meals on a pay as you can afford basis. People will also have access to toys and books for kids and once more established, they will use it as a hub for information whether that be for addiction, cost of living crisis support or general helpful information.

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.</p><p>26 Queen Mary Street, Glasgow, G40 3BB</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.8484297,-4.2196521" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div>
