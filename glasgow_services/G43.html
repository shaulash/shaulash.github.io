    <div class="item"><strong>Auldhouse Community Foodbank</strong><p>Foodbank is open on Thursdays 12.30pm to 2pm giving food, tea/coffee and friendship/support. The foodbank operates a voucher system with vouchers available from community organisations, the jobcentre, GHA, social work, GPs etc. People can also self refer and will be given food and told where to get a voucher for next time.</p><p>Auldhouse Community Church, 51 Netherauldhouse Road, Glasgow, G43 2XG</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.8171941,-4.2916667" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Care and Share: Foodbank and Community Kitchen</strong><p>“Care and Share” is a drop-in ministry when anyone from the local community can come in for some lunch (courtesy of our local Gregg’s) or, if they need, receive several bags of food from our foodbank (which is open between 12-2pm). Normally we require people to bring a voucher with them to use the foodbank. These can be sourced locally through GHA, the Jobcentre, Schools, Health visitors and from a number of organisations whom we partner with. If someone does not have a voucher they can still come and we will fill one out for them on a first visit.Care and Share also provides the opportunity for people to make friends, to have a chat about any concerns or struggles, and to find out about other local organisations who may be able to help them with the situations they find themselves in. We also, on occasions, are able to help people with other items such as clothes, toys, fuel cards and some basic household items. 11:30-2pm.</p><p>Auldhouse Community Church, 51 Netherauldhouse Road, Glasgow, G43 2XG</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.81715,-4.2916855" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Community Spaces</strong><p>Our Community Spaces in Shawlands, Troon and Alloa offer social and canine companionship to people over 60.
