   <h2>Food Hubs</h2>
    <div class="item"><strong>Helping Hands Community Foodbank</strong><p>We are a group of extremely friendly people, passionate about helping others!
We are located on the South Side of Glasgow, at Carnwadric Church of Scotland and open every Thursday between 10.30am and 12.00pm.

If you or anyone you know are struggling to put food on the table, do not hesitate to come. We will always help. We are in this together!
You DON'T need a referral, just come and let us take this burden of you.

If you have any queries just get in touch.</p><p>Carnwadric Parish Church, 556 Boydstone Road, Glasgow, G46 8HP</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.811129,-4.324112" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Glasgow South West Foodbank</strong><p>“The foodbank was there when we really needed it, it was an absolute lifeline.”

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.</p><p>Pollock Foodbank, 100 Priesthill Road, Glasgow, G53 6QL</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.8173419,-4.348555" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Care and Share: Foodbank and Community Kitchen</strong><p>“Care and Share” is a drop-in ministry when anyone from the local community can come in for some lunch (courtesy of our local Gregg’s) or, if they need, receive several bags of food from our foodbank (which is open between 12-2pm). Normally we require people to bring a voucher with them to use the foodbank. These can be sourced locally through GHA, the Jobcentre, Schools, Health visitors and from a number of organisations whom we partner with. If someone does not have a voucher they can still come and we will fill one out for them on a first visit.Care and Share also provides the opportunity for people to make friends, to have a chat about any concerns or struggles, and to find out about other local organisations who may be able to help them with the situations they find themselves in. We also, on occasions, are able to help people with other items such as clothes, toys, fuel cards and some basic household items. 11:30-2pm.</p><p>Auldhouse Community Church, 51 Netherauldhouse Road, Glasgow, G43 2XG</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.81715,-4.2916855" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div>
