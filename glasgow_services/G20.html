    <div class="item"><strong>Glasgow North West Foodbank</strong><p>“The foodbank was there when we really needed it, it was an absolute lifeline.”

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.

To access the foodbank a care professionals such as doctors, health visitors, schools and social workers can issue you with a foodbank voucher. This entitles you to receive a foodbank parcel of non-perishable food.</p><p>Ruchill Kelvinside Parish Church, 15-17 Shakespeare Street, Maryhill, G20 8TH</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.886644,-4.2833111" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Community Food Cupboard</strong><p>Our community food cupboard is stock up with different varieties of food.
