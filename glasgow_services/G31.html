People will also have access to toys and books for kids and once more established, they will use it as a hub for information whether that be for addiction, cost of living crisis support or general helpful information.

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why we provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. We are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.</p><p>142 Helenvale Street, Glasgow, G31 4NA</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.8481659,-4.1988207" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Calton Parkhead Parish Church Foodbank</strong><p>Monday 1pm - 3pm

Please be aware that our phones are not manned on a full time basis and we are closed on Tuesdays. It is also difficult for us to answer calls during foodbank operating times as we are assisting customers.
Please leave a message and we will return your call as soon as possible.

Everyone who comes to the foodbank for emergency food needs to have a valid foodbank voucher.</p><p>142 Helenvale Street, Glasgow, G31 4NA</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.848159,-4.198709" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div>
