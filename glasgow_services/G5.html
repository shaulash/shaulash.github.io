    <div class="item"><strong>Poverty Relief</strong><p>Every Sunday, 1Pm - 3PM, our volunteers distribute food parcels to destitute asylum seekers and refugees.

Every Ramadhan, we provide additional food packs to destitute asylum seekers. These food packs are a lifeline to our service users, some of whom have no income or accommodation.

We aim to continue our food distribution and are working with our scholars to create a trust fund, through which funds can be given directly to impoverished and destitute people within Glasgow.</p><p>1 Mosque Avenue, Glasgow, G5 9TA</p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=55.852292,-4.2513009" target="_blank">View on Google Maps</a></div><div class="item"><strong>Pollockshields Community Food Point</strong><p>Affordable Food Boxes: £5 weekly packs containing fresh fruits, veggies, treats, milk voucher, local store voucher, tinned goods, and rice.
